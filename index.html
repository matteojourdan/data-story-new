    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Understanding why COVID-19 affects patients so differently, and the immunological differences explaining it,
        is crucial for developing effective, personalized treatments.
        To investigate these differences, we analyze a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics dataset profiling more
        than 780,000 immune cells from 130 patients spanning the full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. From this dataset
        we analyze how immune cell populations vary, along with their gene expression levels,
        and how these changes relate to the progression and intensity of the infection.
        Our final goal is to create a predictive model that can use a patient's immune profile, combined with their
        intrinsic data (age, sex, lifestyle factors), to predict an individual’s vulnerability to severe
        COVID-19 and tailor their treatment.</p>
    <p>This website walks you through our data analysis, from cleaning and
        visualizing the data, to identifying and scoring mechanisms linked with disease severity, to finally training
        a predictive model with what we found.</p>
